# FraudDetection Using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a supervised machine learning approach. Fraudulent activity poses significant challenges to financial systems, and early detection helps prevent massive financial losses. Using Python and machine learning libraries, this project builds a logistic regression model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on key features extracted from a given dataset.

## Usage
1.Launch Jupyter Notebook

2.Open FraudeDetection.ipynb

3.Run each cell sequentially to:

    Load and preprocess data

    Train the logistic regression model

    Evaluate model performance

    Visualize results
## Methodology
1.Data Preprocessing:

    -Handled class imbalance using SMOTE Technique


2.Model Training:

        Used Logistic Regression from scikit-learn

        Trained on features selected from the dataset

        Split data into training and testing sets

3.Performance Evaluation:

    -Accuracy

    -Precision

    -Recall

    -F1-score
